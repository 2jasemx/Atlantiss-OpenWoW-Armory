[Greasemonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) / 
[Tampermonkey (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) script to use OpenWoW provided tooltip in Atlantiss.eu Armory character page

### Script and changelog (last 3 updates):
 
[One click install link](https://github.com/xmesaj2/Atlantiss-OpenWoW-Armory/raw/master/ats-owow-armory.user.js) (copy and paste if not working)

* v0.5c - commented unneeded return in async function
* v0.5b - show archeology items icons
* v0.5  - asynchronous thumbnail loading, drastically improved speed


 
### Advantages:
* Has all 4.3.4 patch items (including FL, Ruthless etc and in the future DS) instead just 4.0.6
* v0.3+ loads item thumbnails

### Disadvantages:
 
* my javascipt knowledge is about zero so the code is bad quality
* set bonusses won't work (not implemented in OpenWoW)

### Known issues:
* Gems don't load, if I find a way to get jewel ID from item ID I could fix it. Enchants work though. Not sure reforges can be done.
* Ranged item is still not shown (ATS bug, not script)
* Transmog - not implemented in ATS armory.
* Model viewer - more work needed (I got working model viewer but need to fetch display IDs from different source)

Thanks Cecidit, Naguce≈Ç & Pelekon for feedback
